How to Learn More on Your Own
As you continue learning Android, an important skill to have is the ability to learn on your own. You might find resources out there that feel too advanced for where you are on your journey, but we want you to become accustomed to how developers speak and share their ideas. You don’t have to understand every word, but you can skim for important ideas. Or you can google search for terms that you aren’t familiar with.

Read your first Android blogpost article
Start by reading this post on the Android Developers blog. http://android-developers.blogspot.com/
It's written by Google Design Advocate, Roman Nurik, who was the lead designer on the Google I/O 2014 app. http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/08/material-design-in-2014-google-io-app.html
Google I/O is an annual conference that Google holds for developers.
